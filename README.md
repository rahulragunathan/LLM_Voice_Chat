# LLM Voice Chat
A Python frontend (built using Gradio and LangChain) for talking to ChatGPT or any local model of one's choosing. Speak your responses out-loud in a robot :robot: voice!

## Prerequisites

You can use LLMs from the following sources:

* [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
* OpenAI

To use OpenAI models, you will need to create an [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and have credits to access your model of choice.  
**Note that is *NOT* the same as upgrading to a ChatGPT paid plan (ChatGPT Plus, Pro, etc.).**

Once the above are met, install the required libraries in your Python environment:

``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Python 3.11 and usage of a Python virtual environment are recommended.

## Configuring the Application

### Create an environment file
 
## Starting the Application

Run the command below for your operating system:

On MacOs and Linux (or other bash terminal):

```
.\start_app.sh path/to/env/file
```

On Windows:

```
